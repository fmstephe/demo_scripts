A very basic utility that I will be using to teach git.

The problem I have is that when I run a set of git commands as part of a demonstration it is hard not to make mistakes and it is hard to remember all of the steps.

The answer, a utility that reads commands from a file and runs them one at a time, printing each command as we go.

Even better what if we could go backwards in time. If a question pops up about the previous step I want to go back to that state and play around to demonstrate things.

The answer, there are two scripts. One script contains the demo commands, the other script cleans up everything that the demo commands produce. Every time we run a step we first run the clean up scripts (reset.sh) and run all demo commands (cmds.sh) up to the current point in the demo.

Isn't that slow. Yes, if git weren't as fast as it is this would not be feasible (Also none of my demos do anything over the network).
